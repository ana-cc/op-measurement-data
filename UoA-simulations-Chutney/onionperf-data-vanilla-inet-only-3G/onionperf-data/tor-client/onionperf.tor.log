Mar 14 16:00:02.792 [notice] Tor 0.2.9.16 (git-9ef571339967c1e5) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.1.0j and Zlib 1.2.8.
Mar 14 16:00:02.793 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to be safe at https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning
Mar 14 16:00:02.799 [warn] Option 'RunAsDaemon' used more than once; all but the last value will be ignored.
Mar 14 16:00:02.799 [warn] The SocksListenAddress option is deprecated, and will most likely be removed in a future version of Tor. Use SocksPort instead. (If you think this is a mistake, please let us know!)
Mar 14 16:00:02.799 [warn] The WarnUnsafeSocks option is deprecated, and will most likely be removed in a future version of Tor. Changing this option makes it easier for you to accidentally lose your anonymity by leaking DNS information (If you think this is a mistake, please let us know!)
Mar 14 16:00:02.799 [warn] Option 'SafeLogging' used more than once; all but the last value will be ignored.
Mar 14 16:00:02.799 [warn] Testing options override the deprecated option ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses. Is that intentional?
Mar 14 16:00:02.802 [warn] Option 'RunAsDaemon' used more than once; all but the last value will be ignored.
Mar 14 16:00:02.802 [warn] Option 'SafeLogging' used more than once; all but the last value will be ignored.
Mar 14 16:00:02.803 [warn] You have used DirAuthority or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.
Mar 14 16:00:02.804 [warn] TestingTorNetwork is set. This will make your node almost unusable in the public Tor network, and is therefore only advised if you are building a testing Tor network!
