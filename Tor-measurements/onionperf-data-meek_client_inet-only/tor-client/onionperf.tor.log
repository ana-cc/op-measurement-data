Mar 13 16:20:59.782 [notice] Tor 0.2.9.16 (git-9ef571339967c1e5) running on Linux with Libevent 2.0.21-stable, OpenSSL 1.1.0j and Zlib 1.2.8.
Mar 13 16:20:59.782 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong! Learn how to be safe at https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning
Mar 13 16:20:59.785 [warn] The SocksListenAddress option is deprecated, and will most likely be removed in a future version of Tor. Use SocksPort instead. (If you think this is a mistake, please let us know!)
Mar 13 16:20:59.785 [warn] The WarnUnsafeSocks option is deprecated, and will most likely be removed in a future version of Tor. Changing this option makes it easier for you to accidentally lose your anonymity by leaking DNS information (If you think this is a mistake, please let us know!)
Mar 13 16:20:59.785 [warn] ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured.  This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor.  That's bad!  You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.
